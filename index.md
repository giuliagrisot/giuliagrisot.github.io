# Hello! Welcome to my Personal Website

This is my personal website, where you can have a snippet of my academic journey and interests. As a researcher, I am interested in the mechanisms by which humans process and understand language and literature, and I am dedicated to uncovering the nuances of language through computational analysis.

## Research and Teaching

My interests span various domains, including _empirical approaches to literature_, _digital humanities_, _distant reading_, _eye-tracking_, _stylistics_, _reader response_, and _historical linguistics_. I'm excited to share my knowledge as a Distant Reading teacher starting August 2023 at the University of Cambridge's MPhil in Digital Humanities program.

Previously, I led the research project the project ["High Mountains Low Arousal? Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment in German Swiss Novels in the early 20th Century"](https://mountain-sentiment.github.io/), under Prof. Berenike Herrmann's supervision at Uni Bielefeld. The project provided valuable insights into literary landscapes through distant reading methods and sentiment analysis.

## Get to Know Me

Beyond academia, I love nature and the outdoors; I cook, try to keep fit, play the violin and do my best with a number of other instruments. I like cats and I have a dog.
