## Welcome to my personal website!

I am a researcher interested in the mechanisms by which humans process and understand language and literature, and in the ways linguistic data can be explored computationally.

## Research interests

empirical approaches to literature, eye-tracking, stylistics, reader response, digital humanities, semantic analysis

I am currently part of the research project ["High Mountains Low Arousal? Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment in German Swiss Novels in the early 20th Century"](https://distant-reading-rg.github.io/about.html)

## Former research

My PhD project explored language processing of difficulties in literary texts, with a particular focus on Virginia Woolf. It combined stylistics and psycholinguistics methods (in particular eye tracking), to investigate textual complexities from an empirical viewpoint.

## Bio

I have grown climbing trees and playing ball-games in a small town, learning to love nature and the outdoors. I cook, try to keep fit, play the violin and do my best with a number of other instruments. I have a passion for languages and a innate curiosity towards the mechanisms that allow language understanding.
