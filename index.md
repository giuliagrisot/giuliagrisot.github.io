# Hello! Welcome to my Personal Website

Thank you for visiting my personal website. Here, you'll find an overview of my academic journey, research interests, and a bit about me as a person. As a teacher and researcher, I interested in the mechanisms by which humans process and understand language and literature, with a focus on uncovering the nuances of language through computational analysis.

## Research and Teaching

My academic interests encompass a diverse range of fields, including _empirical approaches to literature_, _digital humanities_, _distant reading_, _eye-tracking_, _stylistics_, _reader response theory_, and _historical linguistics_. As a lecturer in Digital Humanities at The University of Manchester and a researcher at the [Centre for Digital Humanities, Cultures and Media](https://www.digital-humanities.manchester.ac.uk/), I am excited to share my knowledge and contribute to the evolving landscape of these interdisciplinary fields.

### Previous Experience

Before my current role, I taught Distant Reading for the MPhil program in [Digital Humanities at the University of Cambridge](https://www.cdh.cam.ac.uk/). I also worked as the lead researcher on the project ["High Mountains Low Arousal? Distant Reading Topographies of Sentiment in German Swiss Novels in the Early 20th Century"](https://mountain-sentiment.github.io/) with Prof. Berenike Herrmann at the University of Bielefeld. This project explored literary landscapes through distant reading techniques and sentiment analysis, offering fresh perspectives on how sentiment shapes narrative structures.

## Get to Know Me

Beyond academia, I love nature and the outdoors; I cook, try to keep fit, play the violin and do my best with a number of other instruments. I love cats and I have a black greyhound.
These hobbies keep me grounded and inspire my work, reminding me that literature, language, and culture are, at their core, human experiences.
